   Introduction
Welcome to the Pizza Ordering Website ‚Äì a modern, fully functional, and responsive web application designed to provide users with a seamless pizza ordering experience. The goal of this project is to simulate the front-to-back functionality of an online food ordering platform, specifically focused on pizza. Whether a customer wants a classic Margherita or a fully loaded custom pizza with all their favorite toppings, this site makes it easy to browse, customize, and complete an order.

This project was developed as a practical demonstration of modern web development skills, including frontend user experience design, backend data handling, and full-stack application logic. It combines appealing UI design with real-world functionalities like dynamic price calculations, cart management, and responsive layouts to offer a professional and enjoyable user experience.

Project Overview
The pizza ordering website has been built to replicate a realistic and user-friendly food ordering system. It allows users to explore a menu of pre-configured pizzas, customize individual orders, and submit them in a few easy steps. The design emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and mobile responsiveness to ensure a good experience across devices.

The application supports core eCommerce functionality:

Menu browsing

Pizza customization (size, crust, toppings)

Real-time pricing

Cart operations

Order placement

(Optional) Admin dashboard to view and manage orders

Users can view detailed information about each pizza, select size variants (Small, Medium, Large), add or remove ingredients, and see live pricing updates based on their selections. Once satisfied with their order, they can proceed to checkout where they enter delivery details and confirm their order.

Objectives
The key objectives of this project were:

To build a complete food ordering website from scratch using modern technologies.
